# Too Much Information
# Overview
This is as data tracking and dashboard system which I am setting up for my personal life. It is designed to be declarative and extendible.

Scripts will read data models, and produce a cascade of apis, shortcuts, frontends, surveys, databases and charts finally checking archives to see if fully or partially compatible data is ready to load back into the latest iteration. It will be heavily automated. Theoretically, some could adapt this by hooking it up to their own cloud computing and adding/removing whatever data points are being collected to match their needs.


# Front end inspiration
* calendar that sort of matches material ui: https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/scheduler/

* nice little percentage wheel https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/scheduler/

* sidebar with icons that expands, they call it a "drawer": https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/scheduler/

* nice explanation of how to get D3 working with react https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-d3-js-react/

# Devlog
2024-02-10 (4 hrs) Forgot everything I've "done" on this so far. Building Pydantic models. Going to try to get a react app working end to end. Do I need a devlog? Isn't that what git commit messages are for? Idk, I have a lot of boilerplate setup, but I am sure that the way I have configured docker will throw errors.

2023-12-13 (~1.5 hrs?) set up jira, planned a half sprint before my travel later this week

2023-12-14 (1 hour) set up the repo, got started on data classes
